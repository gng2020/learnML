Here are my thoughts on the Kaggle Titanic dataset. 

Firstly, I need to clean up the data: This involves filling in the missing data (or deleting them depending on the size of the data).

Secondly, I need to perform cross-correlations among the features. I suspect things like Class and Ticket Fare contain the same info on the wealth of the individuals. Feature like where they embark could be irrelevant, or tied to their wealth or status.
Similarly, their title (say like "Master" vs "Mr") might also be linked to their status. An appropriate analysis of these features to clean up and slim them down to a social class feature or something would be good.
